# SpotiAuth

This repository can be deployed as a GitHub Pages Page and used as a redirect URL for Spotify Developer Applications.
It will show you all the information Spotify is returning for you to work with. This might be helpful if you want to play around with the spotify api and don't yet have a mechanism in place which handles the output of the spotify login form inside your App.
